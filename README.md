## Use Cases
Lyricist is useful for two main use cases:
1. As a blog (obviously).
2. As a semi-static site engine for websites. E.g. you can use Lyricist to hold/render your about, disclaimer, agb pages.

## How to use
Configure the data directories in the Pippo application.properties file.
```
# Lyricist
lyricist.blogs = rootBlog:root, blog:blog
```
Use the key "lyricist.blogs" for a list of blogs.
Each key inside the list consists of a pair of [blog name]:[blog main directory]. In this example there is a blog called
"rootBlog" and it uses the main directory "root", which translates to `resources/lyricist/root/`.

In each data directory there are two subdirectories: `authors` and `posts`. In `posts` there are all posts 
located. In `authors` are files for all authors of the blog located. Both the posts and authors are Markdown 
formatted with a YAML header. The authors directory is optional. If it doesn't exist or contains no files the author 
support is disabled for this blog.
